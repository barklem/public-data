This archive contains the final rate coefficient results for Ca+H from 
"Estimating excitation and charge transfer in low-energy hydrogen atom 
collisions with neutral atoms: Theory, comparisons, and first application to Ca"
by Paul S. Barklem

The files are:

states.dat - ascii file containing the labels of the states, and energies [cm-1]
*_K.rates  - ascii files containing the tabulated rate coefficients [cm3/s]
*_K.max    - ascii files conatining the maximum value among the various models
*_K.min    - ascii files conatining the minimum value among the various models

The files are in the form (row,column) = (final state, initial state), as 
defined by the labels in the file states.dat
