Cross section data for O+e collisions from Barklem 2007

oxygen_finaltest_allautoplusL20.cross is the original output from the FARM code (Burke and Noble 1995), and read_farmcross.pro is IDL code that reads it into a structure.  write_cross.pro gives an example of rewriting the cross sections in a more easily readable format and different units, and the output is oxygen_final_cross.dat.  The format and units I hope are clear from the files.  Note, only excitation xsects are given.
