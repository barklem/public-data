Some published and unpublished data, provided in electronic form.  Please refer to the relevant papers (listed with the data) for descriptions and cite as appropriate. 

## Atomic data
### Collisional broadening by hydrogen
A general description of how to use Anstee, Barklem & O'Mara theory data is given at http://www.astro.uu.se/~barklem/howto.html.  A general program for interpolating data for broadening of lines neutral atoms from precomputed tables is given at https://github.com/barklem/abo-cross.

#### Collisional broadening by hydrogen for neutrals (broadening - neutrals)

Data for 4891 spectral lines between 2300 and 13000 Angstroms of elements from Li to Ni

These data were published in Barklem et al (2000) (http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2000A%26AS..142..467B) and are incorporated in VALD.

Due to its low loggf, we missed Mg I 4571.  A specific calculation using Thomas-Fermi-Dirac wave functions gives sigma (10000 m/s) = 231 atomic units, alpha = 0.260.

#### Collisional broadening by hydrogen for ionised species (broadening - neutrals)

Data for Cr II and Fe II lines

The data for Fe II was published in Barklem & Aspelund-Johansson (2005) (http://esoads.eso.org/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2005A%26A...435..373B.  The Cr II data was calculated in 2007 due to a request and used in Sobeck et al (2007) (http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007ApJ...667.1267S).  The calculations used the method described in Barklem & Aspelund-Johansson (2005), so if you use the Cr II data you can cite that paper for the method.  These data are also in VALD.
