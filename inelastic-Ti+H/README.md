This archive contains the rate coefficient results for Ti+H from:
"Excitation and charge transfer in low-energy hydrogen atom collisions with neutral manganese and titanium"

The files are:

table2.tex - ascii (LaTeX table) file containing input data for the calculation
table4.tex - ascii (LaTeX table) file containing the labels of the states, and energies [cm-1]
*_K.rates  - ascii files with (all) rate coefficients [cm3/s]: matrix form (row, column) = (final, initial)
*_K.rat    - ascii files with (endothermic) rate coefficients [cm3/s]: list form (by inital state into final states of higher energy)

States are defined by the labels listed in table4.tex.
The number in table#.tex correspond to the table numbering in the article.
